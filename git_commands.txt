Rebase interactive:
- To change commit message
- To squash multiple commits


git rebase -i parent_commit_hash (of commit you want to change)

-> If change commit message then, use reword for that commit and save it.
-> If combine multiple commits then, use squash for latest commit you want to combine in and save it.

To change commit commit message of last commit,
git commit --amend -m "new message"
